# 📊 Feasibility Analysis for Made in Cameroon Marketplace

## 🔭 Vision
A vibrant digital marketplace where Cameroonian talent thrives, powered by technology, trust, and cultural pride.

---

## 1. 🧩 Identify the Problem

### 📌 Problem Statement
Local artisans, farmers, and small businesses in Cameroon struggle to reach broader markets due to:
- Limited access to digital platforms.
- Overshadowing by foreign brands on existing e-commerce platforms.
- Inaccessible or inconvenient payment methods.

Most rely on physical markets that restrict their potential growth. While e-commerce is expanding in Africa, the dominance of imported goods and lack of mobile money integration exclude local producers from truly benefiting.

### 🚧 Key Challenges
- **Limited Market Access**: Local producers are confined to small, physical markets.
- **Foreign Competition**: Imported goods dominate online marketplaces, marginalizing local products.
- **Payment Barriers**: While mobile money is the preferred method for most Cameroonians, many platforms still prioritize less accessible options such as credit cards.
- **Digital Exclusion**: Rural and underrepresented groups lack tools and skills to succeed online.

### 🌟 Opportunity
The moment is ideal to launch a **Cameroon-only marketplace**:
- Mobile money adoption is strong and growing.
- There is a rising cultural and national pride in supporting local goods.
- No major platform focuses exclusively on Cameroonian-made products.

A platform integrated with **MTN Mobile Money** and **Orange Money** can bridge the gap and create equitable digital commerce.

## 2. ✅ Validate the Idea

### 🌍 Market Context
- **Mobile Subscribers**: 19 million+ mobile users in Cameroon.
- **Mobile Money Use**: Over 5.4 million users in 2017 (significantly higher now).
- **Key Payment Systems**: MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money dominate with **interoperability via Mowali**.
- **Existing Platforms**: Platforms like *Buyam* and *Glotelho* support mobile money but sell both local and imported goods — there's no Cameroon-only marketplace yet.

### 🎯 Target Audience
- **Sellers**: Artisans, farmers, cooperatives, and cultural product vendors.
- **Buyers**: Cameroonian consumers, diaspora members, and global buyers seeking authentic local products.

### 🔍 Validation Points
- **Mobile Money Adoption**: Ubiquitous and interoperable — ideal for everyday transactions.
- **E-commerce Growth**: Africa’s digital marketplace is projected to **double by 2030**.
- **Market Gap**: No existing marketplace exclusively serves Cameroonian-made products.
- **Cultural Demand**: Rising interest in platforms like *The Franzys* shows buyers want culturally-rooted, authentic goods.

### ⚠️ Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Platform Competition** | Build strong cultural branding and partner early with local influencers. |
| **API Integration Complexity** | Initiate early talks with MTN & Orange; leverage developer docs and support. |
| **Digital Skill Gap** | Offer onboarding, workshops, and a simple, mobile-first UI. |
