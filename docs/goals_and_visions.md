# 📄 Made in Cameroon Marketplace — Strategic Vision

## ❗ 1. Identifying the Problem

In Cameroon, thousands of talented artisans, farmers, and small business owners produce high-quality local goods every day. However, these local producers face **critical barriers** to reaching broader markets:

- **Limited visibility and access** to digital platforms for showcasing their products.
- **Intense competition** from large international brands that dominate traditional and online retail.
- **Lack of inclusive payment systems**, especially for unbanked or underbanked populations.
- **Digital exclusion**, particularly in rural and underserved communities.

As a result, **local commerce remains underdeveloped**, and Cameroonian consumers often turn to foreign alternatives—not because of preference, but due to convenience and availability.

## ✅ 2. Validating the Idea

Our idea—a **dedicated digital marketplace for locally made products**—is validated by several strong, context-driven signals:

- **Local producers need visibility**: Many want to sell online but don’t have the tools or technical means to do so.
- **Cameroonians increasingly support local**: There is growing national pride and demand for "Made in Cameroon" goods, especially among young and urban populations.
- **Mobile money is widely adopted**: Services like **MTN Mobile Money** and **Orange Money** are already trusted and used daily for transactions, even in rural areas.
- **Digital literacy is rising**: With increasing smartphone penetration and internet access, more Cameroonians are ready to engage in digital marketplaces—if they are inclusive, affordable, and culturally relevant.
- **There’s no major local-first platform**: No large-scale e-commerce platform currently focuses *exclusively* on Cameroonian producers, leaving a major gap in the market.
