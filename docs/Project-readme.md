# Made-in-Cameroon Marketplace

Empowering Cameroonian artisans, farmers, and small businesses to shine—through a secure, locally-focused online marketplace.

## Vision

Empower Cameroonian artisans, farmers, and small businesses with a fast, reliable, and culturally-relevant online marketplace.


## Identify the Problem

- **Limited Market Access**: Local makers rely on crowded physical markets or informal networks, restricting their reach and growth.

- **Foreign Competition**: Imported goods benefit from economies of scale and marketing budgets, overshadowing quality local products.

- **Fragmented Selling Channels**: Sellers juggle social media, multiple marketplaces, and in-person sales, increasing complexity and reducing trust.

- **Payment Friction**: Lack of integrated mobile-money options forces reliance on cash-on-delivery, which is slow, costly, and prone to disputes.

- **Logistics Hurdles**: Unreliable or expensive delivery services outside major cities deter both sellers and buyers.

## Validate the Idea

- **High Mobile-Money Adoption**: MTN MoMo and Orange Money serve millions of Cameroonians, offering a familiar, trusted payment infrastructure.

- **Growing Internet Penetration**: Expanding 3G/4G networks and affordable smartphones make online shopping increasingly accessible.

- **Rising Buy-Local Sentiment**: Consumers are eager to support homegrown talent, preserving cultural heritage and boosting the national economy.

- **Untapped Niche**: Existing platforms (e.g., Jumia) do not exclusively spotlight “Made in Cameroon” goods or tailor to local payment/logistics.

- **Scalable Model**: A successful pilot in Douala and Yaoundé can be replicated nationwide, then across Central Africa.

## Goals

### Technical Goals

- **Modular Architecture**: Develop a scalable, microservices-based backend (Node.js or NestJS) with clear service boundaries.

- **API Performance**: Maintain an average API response time under 200 ms under typical load.

- **Mobile-First Design**: Achieve a Lighthouse performance score ≥ 90 on mobile devices and ensure responsiveness across screen sizes.

- **Security & Compliance**: Implement OWASP Top 10 best practices, 100% HTTPS coverage, and data encryption both in transit and at rest.

- **CI/CD & Testing**: Automate builds, tests (unit/integration), and deployments with GitHub Actions; target ≥ 80% code coverage.

- **Monitoring & Reliability**: Instrument services with Sentry for error tracking and Prometheus/Grafana for metrics; set up alerts for critical thresholds.

### Business Goals

- **Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)**: Reach X FCFA/month in GMV by Month 12.

- **Revenue Share**: Ensure at least 85% of each sale flows back to artisans and producers.

- **Active Users**: Achieve 5,000 registered buyers and 500 active sellers by Month 12.

- **Repeat Purchase Rate**: Attain a 40% buyer repeat rate (second purchase) by Month 12.

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Maintain an average product rating of ≥ 4.5 stars and Net Promoter Score (NPS) ≥ 50.

- **Geographic Expansion**: Launch in two additional major regions (beyond Douala & Yaoundé) by Month 12.
