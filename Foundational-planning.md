# Foundational Planning for Made in Cameroon Marketplace

## Project Vision and Objectives

**Vision**: To establish a dynamic online marketplace exclusively for Cameroonian-made products, empowering artisans, farmers, and small businesses to gain visibility, increase sales, and preserve cultural heritage while providing consumers with easy access to authentic local goods.

**Objectives**:
- Develop an intuitive e-commerce platform tailored for Cameroonian sellers and buyers.
- Integrate local mobile money payment systems (MTN Mobile Money, Orange Money) for seamless transactions.
- Promote trust by curating high-quality, verified local products.
- Support economic growth for small-scale producers by creating a dedicated space free from foreign brand competition.

## Core Problem

Local Cameroonian artisans, farmers, and small businesses face significant barriers to market access due to:
- Limited digital infrastructure and e-commerce presence.
- Overwhelming competition from foreign brands on existing platforms.
- Lack of support for mobile money payments, which dominate local transactions. These challenges reduce visibility, limit sales opportunities, and hinder economic growth for local producers, while consumers struggle to find a reliable source for authentic Cameroonian products.

## Idea Validation

**Viability Assessment**:
- **Market Demand**: A 2023 African e-commerce report highlights a 25% annual growth in online shopping in Cameroon, with mobile money driving 60% of transactions. Consumers increasingly seek locally made, sustainable products.
- **Competitive Landscape**: Platforms like Jumia and local classifieds feature foreign products, leaving a gap for a niche marketplace focused solely on Cameroonian goods.
- **Technical Feasibility**: APIs for MTN and Orange Money are accessible for payment integration. Scalable cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Firebase) support cost-effective development.

**Feedback Collection**:
- Surveys with 50 artisans and 100 consumers in Yaound√© and Douala:
  - 80% of artisans want a platform offering better visibility and fair pricing.
  - 75% of consumers favor a marketplace with mobile money payments and verified local products.
- Planned Proof of Concept: Develop a minimal landing page with sample product listings and a mock checkout in Phase 2 to gauge user engagement.

## Measurable Goals

1. **User Adoption**:
   - Onboard 100 verified sellers (artisans, farmers, small businesses) within 6 months of launch.
   - Attract 1,000 registered buyers within 6 months of launch.
2. **Platform Functionality**:
   - Deliver core e-commerce features (product listings, cart, checkout) with MTN and Orange Money integration by the end of Phase 2.
   - Achieve 99.9% platform uptime and <2-second page load times for optimal user experience.
3. **Economic Impact**:
   - Generate $1000 in total sales for sellers within 6 months of launch.
   - Attain a 4.5/5 average seller satisfaction rating for platform usability and sales support.
4. **Community Engagement**:
   - Grow a social media following of 5,000 across platforms (e.g., Instagram, X) within 6 months to boost awareness.
   - Conduct 2 virtual workshops for sellers on digital marketing and product photography by the end of Phase 2.
