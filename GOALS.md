# 🌍 Vision & Goals — Made in Cameroon Marketplace

## 🧭 Define the Project

**Made in Cameroon Marketplace** is a community-centered digital platform that empowers **local artisans, farmers, and small businesses** in Cameroon by giving them an exclusive online space to showcase and sell **locally made products**.

This initiative aims to foster **economic self-reliance**, **digital inclusion**, and **cultural pride**—all while protecting local commerce from the shadow of dominant foreign brands.

## 🔍 Identify the Problem

Cameroonian small businesses and artisans often lack visibility and access to digital marketplaces. They're overshadowed by international competitors who dominate major e-commerce platforms. This imbalance limits the growth of local enterprises and weakens the domestic economy.

### Key Challenges:
- Oversaturation of foreign brands in existing online markets.
- Limited digital infrastructure for local vendors.
- Inadequate access to trusted and inclusive payment methods.

## ✅ Validate the Idea

The success of **mobile money adoption** in Cameroon (MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money) proves the country is digitally ready. Simultaneously, there is a growing desire among communities to **“buy local”** and invest in sustainable, homegrown businesses.

By merging accessible tech (like the T3 Stack and Rust backend) with a focused mission, this project taps into:
- A **culturally relevant demand** for local products.
- **Untapped potential** in rural and urban communities.
- **Tech-forward youth movements** eager to uplift their local economies.
