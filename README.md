## Made in Cameroon Marketplace: Vision & Goals

## üåç Project Vision
The Made in **Cameroon Marketplace** aims to create a vibrant, inclusive digital economy that celebrates and sustains Cameroonian craftsmanship, agriculture, and small-scale entrepreneurship. By providing a dedicated online platform for locally made products, the marketplace fosters economic self-reliance, cultural pride, and community-driven commerce. It empowers artisans, farmers, and small businesses to thrive in a digital landscape without the overshadowing competition from large foreign brands, while leveraging accessible payment systems like MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money to ensure seamless transactions for all users.

## üîç Identifying the Problem

1- **Limited Market Access for Local Producers:** Artisans, farmers, and small businesses in Cameroon often lack access to broader markets due to limited digital presence, reliance on physical marketplaces, and competition from imported goods.

2- **Dominance of Foreign Brands:** Large foreign brands dominate e-commerce platforms, making it difficult for local producers to gain visibility and compete on price or scale.

3- **Payment Barriers:** Many Cameroonians rely on mobile money services (e.g., MTN Mobile Money, Orange Money), but existing e-commerce platforms often prioritize international payment methods like credit cards, excluding a significant portion of the population.

4- **Digital Exclusion:** Small-scale producers, particularly in rural areas, lack the technical skills or resources to establish an online presence, limiting their economic opportunities.

5- **Cultural Erosion:** The influx of foreign products can overshadow Cameroonian cultural heritage, reducing demand for locally made goods that reflect the country‚Äôs identity.

## ‚úÖ Validating the Idea
The idea for the **Made in Cameroon Marketplace** is validated through the following observations and opportunities:

- **Market Demand:** Growing consumer interest in supporting local businesses, driven by cultural pride and a desire for authentic, sustainable products.
- **Mobile Money Penetration:** Over 70% of Cameroonians use mobile money services (MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money), making local payment integration a viable and inclusive solution.
- **Government Support:** Cameroon‚Äôs government has initiatives to promote local production and digital inclusion, aligning with the platform‚Äôs goals.
- **E-commerce Growth:** The rise of e-commerce in Africa, coupled with increasing smartphone penetration, creates a favorable environment for a localized online marketplace.
- **Community Impact:** By focusing on underrepresented groups (e.g., rural artisans, women-led businesses), the platform addresses social and economic inequities, ensuring broader appeal.
- **Competitive Differentiation:** Unlike global platforms like Jumia or Amazon, this marketplace exclusively promotes Cameroonian products, creating a unique value proposition.

Validation can be further strengthened through:

- **User Surveys:** Conduct surveys among artisans, farmers, and consumers to confirm demand for a local-only marketplace.
- **Pilot Testing:** Launch a minimum viable product (MVP) with a small group of vendors to test user experience and payment integration.
- **Partnerships:** Collaborate with local cooperatives, NGOs, or government agencies to onboard vendors and build trust.

## üéØ Project Goals

1- **Build a User-Friendly Platform:**

- Develop a responsive, accessible web application using the T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, shadcn/ui) for a seamless frontend experience.
- Ensure the platform is mobile-optimized to cater to Cameroon‚Äôs high smartphone usage.


2- **Empower Local Producers:**

- Onboard at least 100 artisans, farmers, and small businesses within the first six months.
- Provide tools (e.g., simple product listing templates, photo upload guides) to help vendors with limited tech skills create professional listings.


3- **Integrate Local Payment Systems:**

- Implement MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money APIs to enable secure, accessible transactions.
- Achieve 90% transaction success rate for mobile money payments within the first year.


4- **Promote Cultural Heritage:**

- Curate product categories that highlight Cameroonian craftsmanship (e.g., traditional textiles, wood carvings, organic produce).
- Feature vendor stories to connect consumers with the cultural and personal significance of products.


5- **Ensure Scalable and Secure Backend:**

- Use Rust (with Axum or Actix-web) and PostgreSQL for a high-performance, secure backend.
- Implement robust user authentication and data privacy measures to build trust.


6- **Foster Digital Inclusion:**

- Offer training resources or workshops for vendors on using the platform, targeting rural and underrepresented communities.
- Partner with local organizations to provide internet access or device support for vendors.


7- **Drive Economic Impact:**

- Generate at least $10,000 in sales for vendors within the first year.
- Create a measurable increase in income for at least 50% of onboarded vendors.


8- **Establish a Sustainable Business Model:**

- Introduce a low commission fee (e.g., 5-10%) on sales to sustain platform operations.
- Explore partnerships with local banks or microfinance institutions to offer vendors growth loans.
