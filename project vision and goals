## Project Vision: Made in Cameroon Marketplace
To build a dedicated digital marketplace that promotes and empowers Cameroonian artisans, farmers, and small businesses by giving them an accessible and fair online platform to sell locally made productsâ€”free from the competition of large foreign brands.

### Identifying the Problem
`Market Saturation by Foreign Brands:` Local vendors are often overshadowed by bigger international brands on existing marketplaces.

`Limited Online Presence:` Many artisans and farmers lack the digital tools or skills to sell their products online.

`Barriers to Payment:` Most platforms rely on credit/debit card payments, which are not widely used in Cameroon.

`Economic Leakage:` A significant portion of the money spent on online marketplaces leaves the country due to foreign product dominance.

### Validating the Idea
`Market Demand:` Increasing mobile phone and internet penetration in Cameroon opens the door for digital commerce.

`User Feedback:` Conversations with local sellers and small businesses reveal frustration with current platforms and a desire for a "local-first" alternative.

`Competitive Gap:` No major marketplace currently exists that focuses exclusively on Cameroonian-made products with integrated mobile money support.

## Defining the Goals
### Commerce Goals
Create an intuitive e-commerce experience tailored to the needs of local sellers and buyers.

Support product categories like handmade crafts, locally farmed produce, clothing, and food.

### Community Empowerment
Highlight and promote underrepresented creators and small businesses.

Provide local sellers with tools, training, and visibility to scale their businesses.

### Tech & Payment Goals
Fully integrate MTN and Orange Mobile Money to support easy, local transactions.

Ensure the platform works well on low-bandwidth connections and mobile devices.

### Trust & Transparency
Include ratings, reviews, and a transparent seller verification process.

Use open-source technologies and clear policies to ensure user trust and data protection.
